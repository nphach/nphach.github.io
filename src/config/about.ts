        "I'm Nikki! I'm originally from Rhode Island and grew up in a Cambodian-American family. My parents were among the many refugees who fled Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime. From them I learned to be resilient, work hard and love learning.",
        "After high school, I was undecided on my career and spent years in food service--waitress, barista, line cook, and so on. Eventually, I found programming to be the ideal blend of creativity and problem-solving, and that I really enjoy it! In May of 2024, I became the first in my family to earn a Bachelor's with a degree in Computer Science.",
        "My experiences have honed my skills in time management, organization, communication, problem solving and attention-to-detail. I'm constantly driven to learn, grow, ask questions and try to things. Outside of programming, I also enjoy crochet, gastronomy, video games and Japanese language study.",
        "As an engineer, my goal is to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of tech and make a positive impact on the world. Let's make something cool!",
