        "Hello! I’m Nikki Phach – a recent graduate looking to jump start my career in software engineering. As an avid learner, I’m always open to exploring new technologies and expanding my skillset. Currently, my focus is on deepening my knowledge of Javascript and front-end development. I'm also interested in machine learning, especially as it relates to NLP technology, due to my personal interest in the Japanese language.",
        "When I’m not coding or speed-running Anki cards, you’ll find me crocheting accessories, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or watching anime. I’m excited about the future and all the opportunities to grow and contribute to innovative projects. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!"
